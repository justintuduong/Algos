// Given an array with multiple values (e.g. [-3, 3, 5, 7]), 
// write a program that prints the maximum number in the array. 
// (The best way to do this is to have the computer go through each number, 
// one at a time, and to update the value in a variable called 'maximum' 
// (or whatever you want to name the variable);  imagine that if I gave you no number 
// and asked you what a maximum number is.  What would you say?  Say the first number 
// I gave you was -3 and asked you what a maximum number is.  What would you say? 
// Say the next number I gave you was 3 and asked you again what a maximum number now is.  
// What would you say?  Have the computer imitate this behavior of updating the maximum number 
// as you iterate through each number in the array).  
// Again you're not to use any of the pre-built functions 

function printMax(arr){
    let max = -Infinity;
    for (let i = 0; i < arr.length; i++){
        if (max < arr[i]) max = arr[i];
    }
    return max;
}

console.log(printMax([-3, 3, 5, 7]));
console.log(printMax([-3, 100, 5, 7]));
